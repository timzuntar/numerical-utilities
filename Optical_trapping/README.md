Simulation of optical trapping of a spherical particle in three different approaches- Ray optics, Lorenz-Mie theory and the Rayleigh limit.

In the latter case, the force exerted by a Gaussian beam is evaluated in both the axial and lateral directions; trapping can be simulated in 3D. LM and Ray optics are only able to simulate movement in the axial direction for now.

Created as part of final project for the Model Analysis 2 course in February 2021.
