# numerical-utilities

A collection of Python and C code snippets I wrote for various projects and classes, which would in all likelihood be filed away and forgotten about. Most concern implementations of numerical computing and data analysis approaches - in the event you are trying something similar, I hope they will be of some use. Keep in mind that portability was not a concern in most cases.

More information on the scripts can be found in their respective subfolders.

### Optical trapping
[Link](https://github.com/timzuntar/numerical-utilities/tree/master/Optical_trapping#readme)

Comparison of three different approaches to simulating axial optical trapping

### Polymer adsorption
[Link](https://github.com/timzuntar/numerical-utilities/tree/master/Polymer_adsorption#readme)

3D simulation of diffusion and interfacial adsorption of molecules for fitting to experimental data

### Model Analysis

Some of the scripts written for course work in the eponymous subject. Currently included are the following problems, although they lack documentation:

- solutions of Navier-Stokes equations for viscous flow in a driven cavity
- implementation of simulated annealing for a 2D Ising model
- computation of oscillation eigenmodes of a weighted membrane with both the QR algorithm and finite element methods
- computation of mass flow through a pipe with both FEM and the Fourier method
- determination of weighted membrane sag via the Fourier method
- computation of the electrostatic field around a charged plate and velocity field around several airfoils with the boundary element method
- Implementation of Hartree-Fock method via the shooting method

### MRI measurement fitting
[Link](https://github.com/timzuntar/numerical-utilities/tree/master/MRI_measurement_fitting#readme)

Fitting of the Mixing-Roughness-Information depth model to experimental secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) depth profiles

### DLA
[Link](https://github.com/timzuntar/numerical-utilities/tree/master/DLA#readme)

2D implementation of a simple diffusion-limited aggregation process and statistical analysis of the aggregates it forms
