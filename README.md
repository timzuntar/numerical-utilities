# numerical-utilities

A collection of Python and C code snippets I wrote for various projects and classes, which would in all likelihood be filed away and forgotten about. Most concern implementations of numerical computing and data analysis approaches - in the event you are trying something similar, I hope they will be of some use. Keep in mind that execution speed was not the top priority in most cases, so optimization is lacking.

More information on the scripts can be found in their respective subfolders.
