# numerical-utilities

A collection of Python and C code snippets I wrote for various projects and classes, which would in all likelihood be filed away and forgotten about. Most concern implementations of numerical computing and data analysis approaches - in the event you are trying something similar, I hope they will be of some use. Keep in mind that portability was not a concern in most cases.

More information on the scripts can be found in their respective subfolders.

### DLA

2D implementation of a simple diffusion-limited aggregation process and statistical analysis of the aggregates it forms

### MRI measurement fitting

Fitting of the Mixing-Roughness-Information depth model to experimental secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) depth profiles

### Optical trapping

Comparison of three different approaches to simulating axial optical trapping

### Polymer adsorption

3D simulation of diffusion and interfacial adsorption of molecules for fitting to experimental data
