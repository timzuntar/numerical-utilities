# numerical-utilities

A collection of Python and C code snippets I wrote for various projects and classes, which would in all likelihood be filed away and forgotten about. Most concern implementations of numerical computing and data analysis approaches - in the event you are trying something similar, I hope they will be of some use. Keep in mind that portability was not a concern in most cases.

More information on the scripts can be found in their respective subfolders.
